Welcome to the Huawei Cloud community!

The Huawei Cloud community is a set of APIs, SDKs and tools open source projects from Huawei Cloud.

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving code, creating new project etc.

### Communicating
The following are communication channel slack, google mailing lists etc for this community.
Anyone who wants helps and has questions about the projects in this community, can get helps and responses
from this channel or this Mailing list.

## How Can I Create a new project?

The [Huawei Cloud Template](https://github.com/huawei-clouds/template) is
a project that contains boilerplate copies of README.md, LICENSE, CONFIGURATION.md
and INSTALL.md files for use by other repos in this community. The new project can
be created according to this template. After the project being created, you can add
some related key words as the topics of this project.

## Your First Contribution

We recommend that you work on an existing issue before attempting
to develop a new feature in a project.

Start by finding an existing issue with the [help-wanted] label in a project;
these issues we've deemed are well suited for new contributors.
Alternatively, if there is a specific area you are interested in,
ask a Project Maintainer for suggestions), and respond on the
issue thread expressing interest in working on it.

This helps other people know that the issue is active, and
hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

Submitting a pull request for a project:

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

  1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
  1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
  1. If your proposed change is accepted,
     and start work in your fork.
  1. Submit a [pull request](CONTRIBUTING.md#Submit-pull-requests) containing a tested change.
